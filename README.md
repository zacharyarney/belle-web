A simple speed reading tool made with React and Zustand.

## Usage

Paste any text you'd like to read quickly into the text box and queue it up in the reader. Select the speed in words-per-minute and press play to go!

The reader emphasizes the beginning of each word to help with word identification. The start of each word is at a
fixed point to minimize the distance you have to scan with their eyes. The reader will pause for slightly longer at the ends of sentences and paragraphs to help with parsing. The speed of the reader can be adjusted while the reader is playing if you find it too fast or too slow. You can also scrub through the queued text with the arrow buttons if you missed a word or want to start from somewhere other than the beginning.
